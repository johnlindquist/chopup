# Task: Resolve Test Failures for `send-input` and Socket Cleanup

## Commit 1: fix: Correct `mainAction` invocation and argument parsing in `src/index.ts` ✅ 6600457bc6a0fe4d7a897da6abe01918ef3389af

**Description:**
The `mainAction` function, when used as the action handler for the `run` command, was not correctly receiving `this` as the Commander `Command` instance due to an incorrect intermediary async arrow function. This commit will:
1.  Modify the `.action()` call for the `run` command in `src/index.ts` to pass `mainAction` directly, allowing Commander to bind `this` correctly.
2.  Update the signature of `mainAction` to `async function mainAction(this: Command, commandToRunArgs: string[], cmdOptionsObj: Record<string, any>)`.
3.  Adjust the internal logic of `mainAction` to correctly extract the command to run (`commandToExecute`) and its arguments (`argsForCommand`) from `commandToRunArgs` (for direct arguments) or `this.opts().passthrough` (for passthrough arguments). Named options like `logDir` and `socketPath` will be read from `this.opts()`.
    *   Files affected: `src/index.ts`

**Verification:**
1.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test test/integration/spawn-wrapper-passthrough.test.ts`
    *   Expected outcome: The "should chop logs on IPC request (echo passthrough)" test should now pass. The timeout error due to `this.opts()` being undefined should be resolved. The test logs should show the wrapper starting correctly and processing the passthrough command.
2.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test test/integration/spawn-wrapper-ipc-request-logs.test.ts`
    *   Expected outcome: The "should create log files on IPC chop request" test should now pass. The timeout error due to `this.opts()` being undefined should be resolved.
3.  **Log Check:**
    *   Observe the general test output when running any test that spawns the wrapper (e.g., `spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts`). The `[WRAPPER_STDOUT]` logs should no longer show the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'opts')`.
    *   The wrapper should print its configuration (log directory, command to run) correctly.

## Commit 2: fix: Ensure `send-input` correctly outputs status and handles IPC client lifecycle ✅ e57f03a9bd7494400e54f398bd118cdb3f04084e

**Description:**
The `send-input` command was experiencing issues with `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` on the server side and its own output (`INPUT_SENT`) not being reliably captured. This commit will:
1.  Modify the `send-input` action handler in `src/index.ts`:
    *   When the server sends `INPUT_SENT` (or an error message) back to the `send-input` client:
        a.  The client will use `process.stdout.write('MESSAGE\n', () => { /* callback */ });` (or `process.stderr.write` for actual errors) to ensure the message is flushed.
        b.  Inside this `write` callback, it will then call `client.end()` to gracefully close its end of the IPC connection.
        c.  In the `client.on('close', ...)` handler, it will then call `process.exit(code)`.
2.  Modify the IPC server logic in `mainAction` (within the `Chopup` class `setupIpcServer` method):
    *   When the server successfully writes `INPUT_SENT` to the `clientSocket` (the one connected to `send-input`):
        a.  It will *not* call `socket.end()` on its side. It will rely on the `send-input` client to close its end after flushing its stdout.
    *   If the server encounters an error writing `INPUT_SENT` *or* is sending an error like `INPUT_SEND_ERROR`, then it *will* call `socket.end()` (if writable) on its side.
    *   Files affected: `src/index.ts` (both `send-input` action and `Chopup` class's IPC handling).

**Verification:**
1.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test test/integration/spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts`
    *   Specific check for `should send input to a wrapped process via send-input command and allow it to proceed`:
        *   The `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END` error in the wrapper's (server's) IPC logs should be gone.
        *   The `[SEND_INPUT_HELPER_SPAWN_EXIT]` log from `input-helpers.ts` should now show `Stdout: "INPUT_SENT\n"`.
        *   The assertion `expect(stdout).toContain('INPUT_SENT');` in the test should now pass.
        *   The test should no longer time out.
    *   Specific check for `should fail gracefully if the target socket path is invalid`:
        *   The `send-input` command's `stdout` (captured as `execStdout` in the test) should contain `CHOPUP_INPUT_SEND_ERROR_NO_SERVER`.
        *   `execError` should be non-null and `execError.code` should be 1.
        *   `execStderr` should be empty.
    *   Specific check for `should fail gracefully if the wrapped process has already exited`:
        *   The `send-input` command's `stdout` should contain `CHOPUP_INPUT_SEND_ERROR_NO_SERVER` (most likely) or `CHOPUP_INPUT_SEND_ERROR_NO_CHILD`.
        *   `execError` should be non-null and `execError.code` should be 1.
        *   `execStderr` should be empty.
2.  **Log Check:**
    *   Observe the test output. For successful `send-input` calls, the wrapper should log `[IPC_SERVER] Successfully sent INPUT_SENT to client. Client will flush, end socket, then exit.`
    *   The `send-input` client's internal logs (if any are unsuppressed temporarily for debugging) should show it entering the `write` callback before `client.end()` and then `process.exit()` in the `close` handler.

## Commit 3: fix: Correct test assertions for wrapper output prefix ✅ e51779dd07992b484eb25c456c840d664aa7c19a

**Description:**
The tests in `spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts` were asserting for `CHOPUP_CHILD_PID=` and `CHOPUP_SOCKET_PATH=` directly in the wrapper's output. However, the `logToConsole` method in the `Chopup` class prepends `[chopup_wrapper] ` to these messages. This commit will update these assertions.
The test for `INPUT_SENT` will also be updated to expect it from the wrapper's stdout with the prefix.
1.  Modify `test/integration/spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts`:
    *   Change `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('CHOPUP_CHILD_PID=');` to `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('[chopup_wrapper] CHOPUP_CHILD_PID=');`
    *   Change `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('CHOPUP_SOCKET_PATH=');` to `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('[chopup_wrapper] CHOPUP_SOCKET_PATH=');`
    *   Change `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('CHOPUP_INPUT_SENT');` to `expect(wrapperOutput).toContain('[chopup_wrapper] CHOPUP_INPUT_SENT');`
    *   Files affected: `test/integration/spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts`

**Verification:**
1.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test test/integration/spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts`
    *   Expected outcome: The test `should send input to a wrapped process via send-input command and allow it to proceed` should now pass all its assertions related to `wrapperOutput` content. If Commit 2 was successful, the entire test should pass.
2.  **Log Check:**
    *   No specific new log checks, but verify the test passes and the wrapper logs show the prefixed messages.

## Commit 4: fix: Address EPIPE error in wrapper's `logToConsole` and improve socket cleanup resilience ✅ ce59c3150f89e1e8f21f219599f5d00cd79042e0

**Description:**
The main wrapper process was encountering an `EPIPE` error when `logToConsole` was called during shutdown, indicating its `stdout` (or `stderr` fallback) was already closed. Additionally, the socket cleanup for `smoke.test.ts` remains an issue.
This commit will:
1.  In `src/index.ts` (`Chopup` class):
    *   Modify `logToConsole`: If both `process.stdout.writable` and `process.stderr.writable` are false, avoid trying to write, to prevent EPIPE. This is a safeguard for very late-stage logging.
    *   In `performFinalCleanup`: Ensure `treeKill` has a timeout. If `treeKill` hangs or fails to call its callback, the cleanup might stall. Add a timeout that forces `performFinalCleanup` to proceed to IPC server closing and socket unlinking after a reasonable delay (e.g., 1-2 seconds) if `treeKill` callback hasn't fired.
    *   In `attemptSocketUnlinkOnExit`: Add a small, brief delay (e.g., 100-200ms) *before* `fsSync.unlinkSync(this.socketPath);` to give the OS a moment to release file handles if the `ipcServer.close()` callback was extremely quick. This is a cautious addition for the stubborn `smoke.test.ts` issue. Log before and after this delay.
    *   Ensure the `process.on('exit', ...)` handler in `Chopup` class calls `attemptSocketUnlinkOnExit` *synchronously* as intended, as it's a last-ditch effort.
    *   Files affected: `src/index.ts`

**Verification:**
1.  **Integration Test:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test test/integration/input-tests/smoke.test.ts`
    *   Expected outcome: The test `should successfully send input to a wrapped script and verify its output` should now pass. Specifically, `expect(socketGone).toBe(true);` should hold.
2.  **Log Check:**
    *   Observe the `smoke.test.ts` wrapper logs. They should show:
        *   `[DEBUG] attemptSocketUnlinkAndExit: Received sockPath='...' ...`
        *   Potentially a log about the pre-unlink delay if added.
        *   `[DEBUG] Socket file '...' exists. Unlinking...`
        *   `[DEBUG] Socket file '...' unlinked successfully.`
        *   `[WRAPPER] Exiting with code 0.`
    *   The `EPIPE` error should no longer appear in the main test output from any test. If `logToConsole` hits a non-writable stream, it should now be silent or log the fallback path only once.

## Commit 5: refactor: Finalize logging and remove temporary debug statements ✅ ce59c3150f89e1e8f21f219599f5d00cd79042e0

**Description:**
Review all `console.log`, `console.error`, `process.stdout.write`, `process.stderr.write` calls added during debugging in both `src/index.ts` and test files.
1.  Remove or comment out verbose debug logs that are no longer necessary for standard operation (e.g., very frequent IPC message logs, excessive pre/post logging for minor operations).
2.  Ensure all intentional logging from the `Chopup` wrapper class uses its `this.log()` or `this.logToConsole()` methods.
3.  Ensure `send-input` command only outputs `INPUT_SENT` (or error codes like `CHOPUP_INPUT_SEND_ERROR_...`) to its `stdout` on success/controlled failure, and is otherwise silent on `stderr`.
4.  Confirm that `suppressSendInputLogs()` effectively mutes any unintended console noise from the `send-input` command itself.
    *   Files affected: `src/index.ts`, `test/integration/test-utils/input-helpers.ts`, potentially `test/integration/spawn-wrapper-send-flag.test.ts` if it has temporary logs.

**Verification:**
1.  **All Tests Pass:**
    *   Run: `pnpm test`
    *   Expected outcome: All tests should pass. There should be no `ERR_STREAM_WRITE_AFTER_END`, `EPIPE`, or unhandled `AssertionError` in the test output.
2.  **Clean Log Output:**
    *   Briefly inspect the test output. It should be relatively clean, with primary output coming from the test runner (Vitest) and intentional diagnostic messages from the tests/helpers (e.g., `[TEST_RUN]...`, `[SMOKE_TEST]...`). Wrapper-specific operational logs should be minimal unless `LOG_LEVEL` (or equivalent) is set high.
    *   The `send-input` command, when run by tests, should only show `INPUT_SENT` (or `CHOPUP_...` error codes) on its stdout capture, and nothing on its stderr capture for controlled scenarios.
